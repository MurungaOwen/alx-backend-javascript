### tests in js
#### Test cases
Create a file 0-calcul.test.js that contains test cases of this function
You can assume a and b are always number
Tests should be around the “rounded” part
Tips:
For the sake of the example, this test suite is slightly extreme and probably not needed
However, remember that your tests should not only verify what a function is supposed to do, but also the edge cases
